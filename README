MongoDB FDW for PostgreSQL 9.2
==============================

This PostgreSQL extension implements a Foreign Data Wrapper (FDW) for MongoDB.
For an example setup that demonstrates this wrapper's use, please see
http://www.citusdata.com/blog/51-run-sql-on-mongodb. Please also note that this
version of mongo_fdw only works with PostgreSQL 9.2.


Building
--------

The MongoDB FDW already includes the official MongoDB C Driver version 0.6. When
you type make, the C driver's source code also gets automatically compiled and
linked.

To build on POSIX compliant systems (Linux and OS X), you simply need to include
the pg_config directory path in your make command. This path is typically the
same as your PostgreSQL installation's bin/ directory path. For example:

$ PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/bin/:$PATH make
$ sudo PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/bin/:$PATH make install

Note that we have tested the mongo_fdw extension only on Fedora and Ubuntu
systems. Please let us know if you run into any issues on other systems.


Usage
-----

The following parameters can be set on a MongoDB foreign server object.

* address: The address or hostname of the MongoDB server. Defaults to "127.0.0.1".
* port: The port number of the MongoDB server. Defaults to 27017.

The following parameters can be set on a MongoDB foreign table object.

* database: The name of the MongoDB database to query. Defaults to "test".
* collection: The name of the MongoDB collection to query. Defaults to foreign
  table name specified in the create command.

As an example, the following commands demonstrate loading the mongo_fdw wrapper,
creating a server, and then creating a foreign table associated with a MongoDB
collection. The commands also show specifying option values in the OPTIONS
clause. If an option value isn't provided, the wrapper uses the default value
mentioned above.

mongo_fdw can collect data distribution statistics and incorporates them when
estimating costs for the query execution plan. In the mean time, you run EXPLAIN
on your queries to see the selected execution plans.

We also currently use the internal PostgreSQL NAME type to represent the BSON
object identifier type (_id field).

-- load extension first time after install
CREATE EXTENSION mongo_fdw;

-- create server object
CREATE SERVER mongo_server FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER mongo_fdw
OPTIONS (address '127.0.0.1', port '27017');

-- create foreign table
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE customer_reviews
(
    _id NAME,
    customer_id TEXT,
    review_date TIMESTAMP,
    review_rating INTEGER,
    product_id CHAR(10),
    product_title TEXT,
    product_group TEXT,
    product_category TEXT,
    similar_product_ids CHAR(10)[]
)
SERVER mongo_server
OPTIONS (database 'test', collection 'customer_reviews');

-- collect data distribution statistics
ANALYZE customer_reviews;

If you are using MongoDB authentication, you will need to indicate that when creating the server:

CREATE SERVER mongo_server FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER mongo_fdw
OPTIONS (address '127.0.0.1', port '27017', use_auth 'true')

Then you must add a user mapping for any PostgreSQL user:

CREATE USER MAPPING FOR (username | CURRENT_USER | PUBLIC)
SERVER mongo_server OPTIONS (username 'mongo_username', password 'mongo_password');


Limitations
-----------

* If the BSON document key contains upper-case letters or occurs within a nested
  document, mongo_fdw requires the corresponding column names to be declared in
  double quotes. For example, a nested field such as "review": { "Votes": 19 }
  should be declared as "review.Votes" INTEGER in the create table statement.

* Please note that PostgreSQL limits column names to 63 characters by default.
  If you need column names that are longer, you can increase the NAMEDATALEN
  constant in src/include/pg_config_manual.h, compile, and reinstall.
